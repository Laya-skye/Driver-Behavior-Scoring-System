# 🚗 Driver Behavior Scoring System

A **Python + Streamlit** web app to evaluate driving behavior using telematics data.  
It calculates a **driver safety score** based on **overspeeding**, **harsh braking**, and **sudden acceleration** events, helping fleet managers or individuals monitor driving performance.

---

## ✨ Features
- **CSV Upload:** Upload a dataset with `speed`, `acceleration`, and `brake` columns.  
- **Driver Scoring:** Calculates a score out of 100 based on driving behavior.  
- **Risk Event Detection:** Counts overspeeding, harsh braking, and sudden acceleration events.  
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize events through a simple bar chart.  
- **Downloadable Reports:** (Planned) Generate PDF summaries of driver behavior.
